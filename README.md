# TensorFlow - Hot or Not?
This is an example of how to use [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library to classify images.

<div align="center">
<a href="https://imgflip.com/i/257ush"><img width="270" height="480" src="https://i.imgflip.com/257ush.jpg" title="made at imgflip.com"/></a>
<a href="https://imgflip.com/i/257uv9"><img width="270" height="480" src="https://i.imgflip.com/257uv9.jpg" title="made at imgflip.com"/></a>
</div>

## Usage

Flow of the app is pretty simple:
1. First of all we're taking a photo.
2. The next step is to classify if it's hot or not.
3. At the end we're showing the results and we can take another photo.
